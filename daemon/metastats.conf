# Mode
Mode "Normal"

# UseTimestamp - Set to 0 (the default) to use the current time on the database
#                server for the timestamp when recording events. Set to 1 to use
#                the timestamp provided on the log data. Unless you are
#                processing old log files on STDIN, you probably want to set
#                this to 0; otherwise you will need to ensure that the clocks on
#                your game servers are accurate. 0=database 1=logs
