# CoreDir - Where can Metastats find its core modules?
CoreDir "./core"

# ModuleDir - Where can Metastats find support modules?
ModuleDir "./modules"

# UseTimestamp - Set to 0 (the default) to use the current time on the database
#                server for the timestamp when recording events. Set to 1 to use
#                the timestamp provided on the log data. Unless you are
#                processing old log files on STDIN, you probably want to set
#                this to 0; otherwise you will need to ensure that the clocks on
#                your game servers are accurate. 1=logs 0=database

### Metastats Updates ###
#########################

# UpdateStable - Metastats can automatically check for available updates 
#                on startup. These are usually very small. Enabling this 
#                is recommended as it will make sure you are always 
#                running the latest and most stable version.
UpdateStable 0

# UpdateBeta - Enabling this will automatically download beta releases of 
#              Metastats, you will always have the latest features, but
#              there may be undiscovered bugs and compatibility issues. 
#              Use at your own risk. (UpdateStable must be 1)
